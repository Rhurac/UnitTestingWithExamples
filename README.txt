This homework is intended to explore example-based unit testing in Python.

Mark Jobs had a brilliant idea of constructing a network of people in which nodes represent people and edges between nodes represent relationships between people.  In this network, he wanted to capture various properties about people and relationships.  Also, he wanted to query the network 1) for persons using their names and 2) for all current friends of current friends of a person.

A slew of developers created different implementations of the network that conform to the following signature/interface.  Now, to select one of these implementations to use, Mark needs your help to identify which of these implementations are correct.  For this purpose, he wants you to write unit tests to test implementations of this signature/interface. [19 points]

  class Network(object):
    def __init__(self):
      # constructor
      pass
    def create_person(self):
      # create a person in the network and return the person
      pass
    def add_person_property(self, person, prop, value):
      # add property to a person
      pass
    def add_relation(self, person1, person2):
      # add a relation
      pass
    def add_relation_property(self, person1, person2, prop, value):
      # add property to the relation between person1 and person2
      pass
    def get_person(self, name):
      # get the person with given name
      pass
    def friends_of_friends(self, name):
      # get a list of current friends of current friends of the person with given name
      pass

Submit your implementation in a single file named test_impl.py.

We will place your submission in a folder with an implementation impl.py and execute "pytest test_impl.py".  Naming your file appropriately to enable this composability is worth 1 point.  We will evaluate your tests on their ability to correctly identify/flag valid and invalid implementations of the signature/interface.

Please resolve any ambiguities about the problem by discussing them with the TA or the instructor ONLY via email or in-person.  When you identify ambiguities, describe them precisely and pose questions about them that will help you resolve ambiguities.  Examples of bad questions would be "what is missing in my implementation?" and "do you think my implementation is complete?"  Examples of good questions would be "Am I right in assuming sun goes around the moon?" and "when you said celestial bodies, did you mean the sun or the moon or something else?"

As mentioned in the policies of the course, collaboration is not allowed on assignments.  So, do not use the discussion board to pose and discuss your questions.
